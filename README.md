## Description

Born out of a need for a convenient source of in-game information, the **TOTK Armor Tracker** app provides an easy, centralized way to track progress for the different armor sets in TOTK. It currently boasts releases on both Windows and Linux.

After creating a save file, you can track which armor sets you have collected so far, view their current upgrade progress, and easily research what items are required next. Check your work at every stage of your TOTK playthrough, without fear of forgetting what items to look for!

## Features

### Appliation-specific Features
* Save progress across multiple save files, as needed.
* View armor details, descriptions, and level-up requirements.
* Sort and filter armor sets, including...
    * Search bar, used to look up specific items/sets
    * Different list orders (sorting by name, level, etc.)

### Project Features
* Written in C++/QML
* Built on the Qt6 Framework, with UI designed via the Qt Quick platform.
* Focus on a simple, easy-to-use GUI
* Multi-platform support

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

No additional downloads are required to run the program - simply download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/noah-black-developer/TOTK-Armor-Tracker/releases) page, unzip the folder, and run the TotkArmorTracker.exe file to start the program.

Supported platforms:
* Windows (10 or newer)
* Linux

### Installing

To install the latest version of the program:
1. Locate the latest app release, either from the [releases](https://github.com/noah-black-developer/TOTK-Armor-Tracker/releases) page or tagged on the project [homepage](https://github.com/noah-black-developer/TOTK-Armor-Tracker).
2. Click on and download the 'Asset' matching your platform (e.g. TotkArmorTracker_Linux.zip for Linux)
3. Once the file has finished downloading, unzip the file to access its contents.
4. Open the unzipped folder and run the **TotkArmorTracker.exe** file.

The TOTK Armor Tracker will now be running and ready to go!

### Executing program

To start tracking armor sets, you can create a new save file by navigating to **File**, then selecting **New**. Enter your new save file name, pre-configure armor as desired, then click "OK" to create the save file and start tracking progress.

Highlighting an armor set from the central grid will list its details to the right side of the window, including:
* Name and Description
* Armor/Set Bonuses (if available)
* Current Defense Rating
* Upgrade Costs

You can mark progress on leveling up a given armor set using the bottom controls.
